## Bits about my assignment
- I decided to do my gallery all on one persons work from pixabay. I was really struggling to find a way to set my work apart from everyone so I decided to make a dark mode toggle.
- I want to spend a little more time with it and see if I can make it so that it toggles between the photos that show up on the page.
- I put the attribution to the artist in the footer in a clickable link to the page they are located at.

## Attribution
- [Icah](https://github.com/Icahpv) was a huge help, assisting me with the dark mode toggle.
- The photos were from [free-photos](https://pixabay.com/users/free-photos-242387/?tab=popular)
